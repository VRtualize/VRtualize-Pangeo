\chapter{Introduction}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/intro:introduction}}\label{\detokenize{test_plan/intro::doc}}

\section{Purpose}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/intro:purpose}}
This test plan contains a description of the testing approach used to create a comprehensive plan for the testing of the Pangeo application which will be provided by the VRtualize team. This document includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Strategy: Test rules and project assumptions including test objectives and certifications; end-to-end description of test set up.

\item {} 
Implementation: How testing is performed, defect management process (reporting, fix planning, and execution).

\item {} 
Management: Description of the logistics of testing.

\end{itemize}


\section{Overview}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/intro:overview}}
The SDSMT VRtualize Team is working together with L3Harris on Project Pangeo. Pangeo is a research project aiming to render the real world in a dynamically loaded virtual reality environment. There are three main goals that contribute to this overall project: imagery retrieval, image caching, and virtual rendering.


\section{Audience}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/intro:audience}}
The intended audience of the test plan is the Project Manager, Development team, and QA team. Some portions of this document may on occasion be shared with the client/user and other stakeholder whose input/approval into the testing process is needed.


\chapter{Strategy}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:strategy}}\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:id1}}\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy::doc}}

\section{Objectives}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:objectives}}
Test objectives are meant to verify that the Pangeo application meets design specifications.

Testing will include the execution of automated tests, test scripts, and performance tests.
Criteria for the cessation of testing:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Production ready  software (as per the Software Requirements Specification (SRS))

\item {} 
Automated tests and test scripts suitable for reuse as functional and user-acceptance testing.

\end{itemize}


\section{Assumptions}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:assumptions}}
\sphinxstylestrong{General}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Environment downtime will adversely impact test schedules.

\item {} 
Test environment will exactly duplicate the production environment.

\item {} 
Issue reporting includes complete reproduction details (as per Issue Reporting Template).

\item {} 
Issues are tracked using the ZenHub Issue Tracking System only.

\item {} 
Issues reported fixed after Certification N will include regression tests which will be added to the test plan for Certification N+1.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxstylestrong{Key Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Certifications are defined as follows:

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\section{Testing Scope}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:testing-scope}}

\subsection{Unit}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:unit}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} During product development

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} Primarily for the purpose of identifying bugs at the unit level as early as possible

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} User stories, separate modular functions, scripts

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} All major software components will be developed using Unityâ€™s built-in Test Runner which utilizes the NUnit framework or the Python module, unittest


\subsection{Back-end}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:back-end}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} During database setup

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To avoid complications like deadlock, data corruption, and data loss

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} Database

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Tests will be developed as SQL queries


\subsection{Code Reviews}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:code-reviews}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} Within 4 days of an issue going into Review/QA pipeline

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To ensure that the code upholds coding standards

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} All units of code

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Team members working on the same Certification will be required to participate and approve code reviews with the author of the code. Results in one of three results:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Pass: An ok to push to merge with next branch

\item {} 
Revision/Pass: Can be pushed after some changes

\item {} 
Fail: Too many problems, will require another code review

\end{itemize}


\subsection{QA Testing}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:qa-testing}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} QA Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} After units of code passes code reviews

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To ensure units of code pass user acceptance criteria

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} All units of code

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Using the testing software used to create the unit, back-end, and user acceptance tests


\subsection{Integration}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:integration}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} Combining individual units of code

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To expose defects in the interfaces and interactions between integrated components or systems

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} Interaction between the database and the application, simulating the key interactions of a user using the application

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Tests will be developed using the Integration Test Framework, which is part of the Unity Test Tools package


\subsection{Regression}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:regression}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} When a defect is discovered

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To make ensure the reproduction of the failing case and recognize when that failure is fixed

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} Specific to the defect

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Depending on the type of defect found, the regression test could be a User Acceptance Test or use the same format as a unit test


\subsection{System and Functional}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:system-and-functional}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} QA Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} Prior to Exploratory Testing

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} Thorough testing of all application functions

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} All required features of the application as described in the SRS

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Tests are performed using scripts, automated processes, and input decks.


\subsection{Soak and Performance}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:soak-and-performance}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} Any new system update

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To ensure the application does not have any memory leaks and performs to the agreed-upon performance specification

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} Memory management, algorithms, and loading time

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Unity Profiler and Unity Performance Testing Extension to internally monitor performance and optimizations of key systems.


\subsection{Stress}
\label{\detokenize{test_plan/strategy:stress}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Who:} Development Team

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} Before product release

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} To determine the acceptable user limitations

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} Algorithms and loading time

\sphinxstylestrong{When:} After functional tests

\sphinxstylestrong{Why:} Primarily to familiarize the alpha testers with the features and behavior of the software to set expectations for new features and identify any hiccups

\sphinxstylestrong{Scope:} Production level product

\sphinxstylestrong{How:} Testers are encouraged to try the interface without scripts or documentation

\sphinxstylestrong{Deliverables:} UAT Test Cases written by Development Team and reviewed and signed off on by Development Team and Project Manager

Resource availability

Low

Unable to receive information we need to render a specific location. Users will no longer be able to use the application that requires information that we donâ€™t currently have for the next 24 hours.

Ensure proper storage of repeatedly used testing resources, and understanding capabilities of API token reuse to minimize new API calls.
\\

Unforeseen Delays
&
Low
&
Impossible to tell the impact due to not knowing the issue. It could potentially create a time slip and we will not be able to deliver the product that we have agreed to produce for L3Harris, which may impact future projects with the company.

Work will be scheduled the highest priority in the next Sprint. During Christmas break there will be some time to make up for time slips that may occur to get the project back on schedule for development for Certification 3.
